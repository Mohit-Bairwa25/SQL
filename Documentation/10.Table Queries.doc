## UPDATE Statement

**Used to modify existing rows in a table.**

**Syntax:**

```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
```

**Explanation:**

- **`UPDATE table_name`**: Specifies the table you want to update.
- **`SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...`**: Lists the columns and their new values.
- **`WHERE condition`**: Specifies the condition that rows must meet to be updated.

**Example:**

```sql
UPDATE student
SET grade = "0"
WHERE grade = "A";
```

This query will change the grade of all students with a grade of "A" to "0".

This will throw an ERROR
13:35:33	UPDATE student SET grade = "0" WHERE grade = "A"	Error Code: 1175. You are using safe update mode and you tried to update a table without a WHERE that uses a KEY column.  To disable safe mode, toggle the option in Preferences -> SQL Editor and reconnect.	0.016 sec

You have to turn off safe mode
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES=0;

## DELETE Statement

**Used to delete existing rows from a table.**

**Syntax:**

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

**Explanation:**

- **`DELETE FROM table_name`**: Specifies the table from which you want to delete rows.
- **`WHERE condition`**: Specifies the condition that rows must meet to be deleted.

**Example:**

```sql
DELETE FROM student
WHERE marks < 33;
```

This query will delete all rows from the `student` table where the `marks` column is less than 33.
