Creating table
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column_name1 data_type constraints,
    column_name2 data_type constraints,
    ...
);

•CREATE TABLE student (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    age INT NOT NULL
);
14:58:12	CREATE TABLE student (     id INT PRIMARY KEY,     name VARCHAR(50),     age INT NOT NULL )	0 row(s) affected	0.046 sec

Insert Data in Tables
•INSERT INTO student VALUES(1,"AMAN",26);
•INSERT INTO student VALUES(1,"SHRADHA",26);

Primary Key Should Be Different

15:00:56	INSERT INTO student VALUES(1,"AMAN",26)	1 row(s) affected	0.016 sec
15:02:57	INSERT INTO student VALUES(2,"SHRADHA",26)	1 row(s) affected	0.016 sec

•SELECT * FROM student;
	id	name	age
	1	AMAN	26
	2	SHRADHA	26
